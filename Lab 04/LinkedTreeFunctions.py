'''
Function which takes the root node of a sorted binary tree and an element.
  This function finds where in the binary tree that the element should be
  inserted (by using the algorithm provided in the lab booklet) so that the
  the tree stays in order.
PARAM:   root_node      The root of the linked list
PARAM:   new_element    The new element to be added into the list
RETURNS: The node at the root of the sorted binary tree.

'''
Function which takes the root node of a binary tree and prints the tree using
  inorder traversal. Inorder traversal prints the left subtree first, then
  prints the element in the current node, then prints the right subtree.
PARAM:   root_node      The root of the linked list

'''
Function which takes the root node of a sorted binary tree and an element.
  This function searchs the tree for that element using an iterative
  methodology. As it goes, the function creates a path of element in the nodes
  traversed and returns that path at the end.
PARAM:   root_node      The root of the linked list
PARAM:   element        The element to be found in the tree
RETURNS: The path through the tree from the root to the element's node, or
           None if the element cannot be found in the tree.

'''
Function which takes the root node of a sorted binary tree and an element.
  This function searchs the tree for that element using a recursive
  methodology. As it goes, the function creates a path of element in the nodes
  traversed and returns that path at the end.
PARAM:   root_node      The root of the linked list
PARAM:   element        The element to be found in the tree
RETURNS: The path through the tree from the root to the element's node, or
           None if the element cannot be found in the tree.
